# üí∞ Gold Rate Prediction using Machine Learning and MLOps

This project predicts the gold rate based on the USD to INR exchange rate using a Machine Learning pipeline. It includes data cleaning, model training, serialization using `pickle`, deployment using Gradio UI, and automatic data logging to Google Sheets.
